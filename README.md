# Flappy AI 

A Flappy Bird game clone built using Unity, with AI trained using ML-Agents.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- ML-Agents 0.30.0
- Protobuf 3.20.0
- NumPy 1.21.2
- Torch

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/princeVegeta2/flappyAI.git`
2. Navigate to the `UnityProject` directory to access the Unity project.
3. You can build the project or train it in your Unity editor.

## Training the AI

If you wish to start training the AI from scratch, navigate to the built solution folder and run this command(Windows): 
``mlagents-learn config/bird_config.yaml --env FlappyAI --run-id=custom_name``

## Playing the Game

You can also launch the FlappyAI.exe file to play the game yourself.

## Note
This is a fun project I have built to familiarize myself with machine learning and Unity. If you can improve my project or have any tips for me to follow, feel free to contact me.
